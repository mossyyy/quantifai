# AI Code Analyzer Refactoring Roadmap

## Executive Summary

**Project Goal**: Refactor the AI Code Analyzer project into a maintainable monorepo architecture with independent VSCode extension and Next.js web application, sharing a common core library.

**Current Status**: 🚧 Phase 4 In Progress - Next.js Migration Underway

**Last Updated**: January 6, 2025 (Updated with actual progress)

---

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ What We Have
- **VSCode Extension**: Functional AI detection and code review analysis
- **React Web App**: Basic visualization and parameter tuning interface
- **Comprehensive Services**: Well-structured service layer with good separation of concerns
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript implementation with proper typing

### ❌ Current Issues
- **Code Duplication**: AI detection logic implemented differently in both projects
- **Type Inconsistency**: Similar but different type definitions across projects
- **Monolithic Components**: Large components mixing UI and business logic
- **Manual Data Flow**: Cumbersome file import/export workflow
- **Framework Limitations**: Basic React setup without modern patterns

## Risk Mitigation

### Backup Strategy
1. **Git Branches**: Each phase will be completed on a separate branch
2. **Rollback Points**: Clearly defined points where we can safely revert
3. **Incremental Migration**: Each package can be migrated independently
4. **Parallel Development**: Old and new systems can coexist during migration

### Potential Risks
- **Type Conflicts**: Different type definitions between projects
- **Dependency Issues**: Circular dependencies or version conflicts
- **Performance Regression**: New architecture might be slower initially
- **Feature Parity**: Ensuring all existing functionality is preserved

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Maintain test coverage throughout migration
- **Incremental Validation**: Test each phase before proceeding
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed notes of all changes
- **Rollback Plan**: Clear procedures for reverting changes
