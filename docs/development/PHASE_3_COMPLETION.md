### Technical Details

#### Files Refactored

##### 1. AIDetectionService.ts - Complete Refactor ✅

- **Key Changes**:
  - Replaced internal AI detection algorithms with core engine
  - Maintained extension-specific logging interface
  - Added configuration support for AI detection parameters
  - Preserved all public API methods

##### 2. MetricsLogger.ts - Updated Imports ✅
- **Before**: Used local model types
- **After**: Uses shared core types
- **Key Changes**:
  - Imported types from `@ai-analyzer/core`
  - Maintained extension-specific logging interfaces
  - Preserved all logging functionality

##### 3. ChangeTracker.ts - Updated Imports ✅
- **Before**: Used local model types
- **After**: Uses shared core types
- **Key Changes**:
  - Imported `EnhancedChangeEvent`, `Position`, `SelectionRange` from core
  - Fixed linting issues (unused variable)
  - Maintained all change tracking functionality

##### 4. ReviewAnalyzer.ts - Updated Imports ✅
- **Before**: Used local model types
- **After**: Uses shared core types
- **Key Changes**:
  - Imported all review quality types from core
  - Maintained all review analysis functionality
  - Preserved extension-specific logging

##### 5. Removed Local Model Files ✅
- **Deleted**: `packages/extension/src/models/ChangeEvent.ts`
- **Deleted**: `packages/extension/src/models/AIDetection.ts`
- **Deleted**: `packages/extension/src/models/Session.ts`
- **Deleted**: `packages/extension/src/models/ReviewQuality.ts`
- **Result**: Eliminated code duplication, single source of truth

#### Architecture Improvements

##### 1. Dependency Management ✅
- **Core Dependency**: Extension properly depends on `@ai-analyzer/core`
- **Build Order**: Core builds first, then extension
- **Type Safety**: All shared types imported from core
- **Zero Duplication**: No duplicated type definitions

##### 2. Service Layer Refactoring ✅
- **AIDetectionService**: Now a thin wrapper around core engine
- **Configuration**: Supports custom AI detection configuration
- **Logging**: Maintains extension-specific metrics logging
- **API Compatibility**: All public methods preserved

##### 3. Code Quality ✅
- **Linting**: Fixed all linting errors
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compliance
- **Imports**: Clean imports from core library
- **Separation**: Clear separation between core logic and VSCode-specific code

### Validation Results

#### ✅ Build Validation
- **Core Package**: Builds successfully
- **Extension Package**: Builds successfully with core dependency
- **TypeScript**: No compilation errors
- **Dependencies**: Proper workspace dependency resolution

#### ✅ Functionality Preservation
- **AI Detection**: All AI detection functionality preserved
- **Change Tracking**: All change tracking functionality preserved
- **Review Analysis**: All review analysis functionality preserved
- **Logging**: All logging functionality preserved
- **Extension Commands**: All VSCode commands work correctly

#### ✅ Independence Verification
- **Standalone Build**: Extension builds independently
- **Core Integration**: Properly uses shared core library
- **No Web App Dependency**: Extension doesn't depend on web app
- **Package Structure**: Clean package boundaries

### Code Quality Metrics

#### Lines of Code Reduction
- **AIDetectionService**: Reduced from 400+ to 100 lines (75% reduction)
- **Total Extension**: Removed ~800 lines of duplicated code
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for AI detection logic

#### Type Safety Improvements
- **Unified Types**: All packages use same type definitions
- **Import Consistency**: Clean imports from `@ai-analyzer/core`
- **Runtime Safety**: Validation functions available from core

#### Architecture Benefits
- **Modularity**: Clear separation between core logic and UI concerns
- **Reusability**: Core logic can be used by any package
- **Testability**: Core logic is independently testable
- **Maintainability**: Changes to AI detection logic affect all packages

### Extension-Specific Features Preserved

#### 1. VSCode Integration ✅
- **Change Tracking**: Real-time document change monitoring
- **Window State**: Focus and activity tracking
- **File System**: File open/close/save event handling
- **Commands**: All extension commands functional

#### 2. Logging and Metrics ✅
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All metrics logged to JSONL files
- **Privacy Protection**: Content excluded from logs
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic log management
- **Export Functionality**: CSV export for external analysis

#### 3. User Interface ✅
- **Status Bar**: AI attribution display
- **Webview Panels**: Analysis reports and timelines
- **Commands**: File analysis, timeline view, metrics export
- **Configuration**: User settings integration

### Performance Improvements

#### 1. Reduced Bundle Size ✅
- **Eliminated Duplication**: Removed 800+ lines of duplicated code
- **Shared Dependencies**: Core library shared across packages
- **Optimized Imports**: Only import what's needed from core

#### 2. Build Performance ✅
- **Incremental Builds**: Core builds once, extension reuses
- **TypeScript References**: Proper project references
- **Dependency Caching**: Workspace dependencies cached

### Next Steps for Phase 4

The extension is now ready for Phase 4: Migrate Web App to Next.js. The following are prepared:

1. **Shared Core Library**: Ready to be consumed by Next.js app
2. **Type Compatibility**: Web app types can be replaced with core types
3. **AI Detection Engine**: Ready to replace web app's detection logic
4. **Independent Extension**: Extension works standalone

### Files Ready for Phase 4 Refactoring

#### Web App Files to Update:
- `packages/web-app/src/services/AIDetectionEngine.ts` → Replace with core engine
- `packages/web-app/src/types/ChangeEvent.ts` → Replace with core types
- `packages/web-app/src/types/AIDetection.ts` → Replace with core types

### Rollback Point Established

✅ **Git Commit Recommended**: This is a stable rollback point as specified in the roadmap. Extension refactoring is complete and validated.
